## Exercises

### April 3, 2021

1. Edit the [following Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/bodie-exercise-01-8vg8u) and make the following changes
1. Inside the `index.css` file, I would like a bunch of rules defined:
    * heading 1 should have `red` text colour
    * heading 2 should have a `orange` background colour
    * heading 3 should be normal weight font, not bold
    * anchor elements (`<a>`) should be the colour `purple`
    * paragraph text should italicized & paragraph text should be text colour `#2F4F4F`
1. Inside the main `index.html` page:
    * I'd like you to link to the `index.css` stylesheet so all our rules from step 1 are available
    * Create a hyperlink/anchor (`<a>`) to the `./bodie-01.html` page.  I think placing this new link inside a paragraph element would be great.  This link will take the website visitor to the `bodie-01` page!
1. In the `bodie-01.html`:
    * I'd like you to link to the `index.css` stylesheet so all our rules from step 1 are available
    * Please use at least one `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>` headings inside the page ... I want to see all their beautiful colours
    * In between your headings I would like you to create some paragraph text
1. Send Dan a text to let him know that your are done!
1. Dan will visit the [preview page of your Code Sandbox](https://8vg8u.csb.app/) to see all of your changes!
