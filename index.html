    <h1>This Is Bodie's First Website!</h1>
    <p>
      This is a place where we can practice writing good html and css code.  Once the 
      code is <em>committed</em> it will automatically be available at 
      <a href="https://itzdanger2727.github.io/banana-bodie/">https://itzdanger2727.github.io/banana-bodie/</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn't a perfect way to work just yet, but it get's us started!
